### Hi, my name is Carlos Castro
----

I make things happen in Technology.

I like to work on the web, mentor others, advocate for accessibility, teach new topics, review performance on apps, make good tools for developers, Infrastructure, and in general untangle code bases to their minimal, most easy-to-understand implementation.

If I would say something good about me in my everyday work is: I care. I will go beyond and give the extra mile to succeed in what I'm doing.
